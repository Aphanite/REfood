**REfood** is an innovative Rails web app, creating a virtual marketplace for purchasing food items close to their best before date.

The mission? To reduce food waste while providing you with a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience.

👨‍💻 **Behind the Scenes**:
This project was brought to life by a passionate team of four in a month-long effort, which I had the pleasure of leading during an exhilarating six-month journey at Le Wagon coding bootcamp.
